# Sorting_Efficiency_Analysis
  This code tests several sorting algorithms with different array sizes of 10^1,10^2....10^6. Each sorting algorithm is given three type of arrays for each magnitude of array, they are given increasing, decreasing, and random numbered arrays. The code analysis is listed in the "analysis" file.
